## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

- **Redux**: A state management tool for managing application state.

- **React DnD**: A drag-and-drop library for React applications.

- **React Hot Toast**: Notifications for task actions like creation and deletion.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

- **uuid**: For generating unique task IDs

## Components

1. **App.jsx**

This is the root component that integrates all the main features of the application. It sets up the drag-and-drop context using ***DndProvider***, initializes the tasks from local storage, and manages the layout of the main components like ***Search***, ***CreateButton***, and ***ListTasks***.

2. **CreateButton.jsx**

A button that opens a modal for creating a new task. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and handles the opening and closing of the modal.

3. **CreateTask.jsx**

A form inside the modal where users can enter the task name and description. It dispatches the addTask action to save the new task.

4. **Header.jsx**

Displays the section header, including the title and the count of tasks in that section.

5. **ListTasks.jsx**

Renders the sections of tasks categorized by their status ("To Do", "In Progress", "Peer Review", "Closed"). Each section displays tasks that can be dragged and dropped.

6. **Modal.jsx**

A modal component that wraps the ***CreateTask*** form. It handles closing the modal and includes a close button.

7. **Search.jsx**

An input field that allows users to search tasks by name. It updates the ***searchQuery*** in the Redux store.

8. **Section.jsx**

Renders a specific task section based on status. It integrates the drag-and-drop functionality and displays tasks that belong to that section.

9. **Task.jsx**

Represents an individual task in the list. It supports dragging to move the task between sections and includes a delete button to remove the task.

## State Management

The application uses Redux for state management, particularly the ***taskSlice*** for handling tasks and search functionality.

1. **taskSlice.js**

- **State Structure:**
    - ***tasks***: An array of task objects.
    - ***filteredTasks***: An array of tasks filtered by the search query.
    - ***searchQuery***: The current search query string.

- **Reducers:**
    - ***setTasks***: Sets the list of tasks.
    - ***addTask***: Adds a new task to the list.
    - ***removeTask***: Removes a task from the list.
    - ***updateTaskStatus***: Updates the status of a task (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress").
    - ***setSearchQuery***: Updates the search query for filtering tasks.

2. **store.js**

Configures the Redux store and integrates the ***taskSlice*** reducer.

## Styling

- **Tailwind CSS:** Used for styling components. The utility-first CSS framework allows for quick and responsive design.

- **Custom CSS:** Some components use additional custom styles for specific UI elements, such as the modal.
